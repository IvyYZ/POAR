A PyTorch Lightning solution to train pedestrian open attribute recognition models

## Dependencies
```bash
pip install 'git+https://github.com/katsura-jp/pytorch-cosine-annealing-with-warmup'
pip install pytorch-lightning
```
 
## Usage ðŸš‚

### Finetuning ðŸš†

```
python train_finetune.py --folder data_dir --batch_size 512
```
 
### Testing ðŸš†

```
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 python test_UDA_T2I.py --testset PA100K --trainset PETA --folder  ./test/dataset/PETA/
```

### Training with our DataModule ðŸ“‰

As long as each of the image pairs have the same stem name (i.e. `img1.png` and `img1.txt`) all that you need to do is specify the folder on runtime. Any subfolder structure will be ignored, meaning `foo/bar/image1.jpg` will always find its `myster/folder/image1.txt` so long as they share a common parent folder. All image suffixes will work, the only expectation is that captions are separated by `\n`.


## Goal âš½

Our aim is to create an easy to use Lightning implementation of pedestrian open attribute recognition. We will live by:
